# 🐍 Ophidia

Ophidia is a Minecraft pathfinder with the goal of emulating realistic player movement, despite movement speed.

## How can I use this?

Create a 1.8.9 Forge project and copy the code provided. Inside Minecraft, run the /travel <x> <y> <z> command.

## Technical

Ophidia uses A* along with string-pulling optimisations, finding valid paths across nodes computed by the A* algorithm.

The license is intentionally unrestricting so you may use this freely in projects where you would find Ophidia useful. All I ask for in return is a star 🙂.
