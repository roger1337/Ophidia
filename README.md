# Ophidia
---
Ophidia is a Minecraft pathfinder with the goal of emulating realistic player movement.
---
### How can I use this?
---
Create a 1.8.9 Forge project and copy the code provided. Inside Minecraft, run the /travel <x> <y> <z> command.
---
### Demonstration
---
### Technical
---
Ophidia uses A* along with string-pulling optimisations, finding valid paths across nodes computed by the A* algorithm.
---
The license is intentionally unrestricting so you may use this freely in projects where you would find Ophidia useful. All I ask for in return is a star ðŸ™‚.
